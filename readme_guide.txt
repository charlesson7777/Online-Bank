## Design Decisions 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We separated the Objects into 3 major types: Bank Objects, Communication, and UI. Bank Objects mainly contain attributes that we set using information from the database. Objects under communication deal with mutating objects and directing UI updates. Objects under UI hold UI objects and themes and also UI navigation. 


## Notes 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can change the exchange rate through the DB. 
The data is stored on cloud, so multiple devices can share the consistent information.
We have a set theme for the UI.

## How to compile and run
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your directions on how to run the code. Ideally should resemble the lines below

1. Navigate to the directory "YourCodeDirectory" after unzipping the files
2. Run the following instructions:

## testing
Go to Source
javac *.java
java -cp .:mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar Main

Windows
Setup mysql connector : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-installation-binary-windows.html
del /s *.class
javac *.java
java -cp .;mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar Main


Design
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our program likely follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The
separation into UI elements (view), database or business logic (model), and the interaction
between them (controller) is hinted at with classes like the InstanceManager class, which could
act as a part of the controller managing the flow between the UI and the data models.
Model Design
Factory Pattern:
The use of factories is evident in creating UI components or handling specific operations
that are dependent on the application state or user type. This could involve creating different
types of forms or panels based on user privileges or account types. The factory method might
be used in PanelAccountsHolder to generate different table settings based on account types.
Strategy Pattern:
This is utilized in the form validation and communication handling where different
strategies for validation or data fetching are encapsulated in classes that can be interchanged
within the family hierarchy. For example, FormValidation classes act as strategies that are used
dynamically within forms to validate user input based on different criteria.
Singleton Pattern:
Used in database and manager classes such as DB and InstanceManager, ensuring that
only a single instance of the manager is instantiated across the application, which is typical in
handling database connections and session management.
In conclusion, the model design in the program reflects a structured approach to
building a robust and scalable Java Swing application. The design incorporates several key
principles and patterns that facilitate clean separation of concerns, modular architecture, and a
consistent user interface.
